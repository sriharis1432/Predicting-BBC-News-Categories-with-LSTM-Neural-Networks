# Predicting-BBC-News-Categories-with-LSTM-Neural-Networks

step1: Import the libraries
step2: Import the dataset
step3: separates the list of articles and labels (remove stopwords)
step4: train dataset, test dataset
step5: Tokenizer are used to token thw words
step6: after tokenization, tuens those token inot list of sequence. To train neural network sequence sjould be same length so we apply padding.
step7: evalvate the model
