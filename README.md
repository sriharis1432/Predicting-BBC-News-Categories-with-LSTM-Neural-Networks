# Predicting-BBC-News-Categories-with-LSTM-Neural-Networks

step1: Import the libraries

step2: Import the dataset

step3: separates the list of articles and labels (remove stopwords)

step4: train dataset, test dataset

step5: Tokenizers are used to token the words

Step6: after tokenization, turns those token into the list of sequences. To train the neural network sequences should be the same length so we apply padding.

step7: evaluate the model
